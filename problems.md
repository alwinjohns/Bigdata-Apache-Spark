Here we are trying to solve following 5 problems using Yelp public dataset:
#note: We have already done data cleansing, wrangling and pre-processing on this dataset.

Prob 1.	List	the		business_id	,	full	address	and	categories	of	the	Top	10	highest	rated	businesses	using	the	average	ratings.	
(Hint: Use reduce	side	join)

Prob 2. Read	a	user	name	from	the command	line	and	find	the	average	of	their	review	rating.

Prob 3.	List	the	'user	id'	and	'stars'	of	users	that	reviewed	businesses	located	in Stanford.

Prob 4.	List	the		user_id	,	and	name of	the	top	10	users	who	have	written	the	most reviews.
